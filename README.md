# Concrete-Strength-Prediction-Using-ML

To know the quality of concrete we check strength of concrete.The Compressive Strength of Concrete determines the quality of Concrete, we check it by standard crushing test on a concrete cylinder. Concrete strength is also considered a key factor in obtaining the desired durability. For testing strength it will take 28 days this is a large time, So what we will do now? By use of Data Science, we reduce this lotâ€™s of effort we will predict that in how much quantity we have to use which raw material for good compressive strength.

So, we are going to analyze the Concrete Compressive Strength dataset and build a Machine Learning model to predict the quality:

cement: a substance used for construction that hardens to other materials to bind them together.

blast_furnance_slag: Mixture of metal oxides and silicon dioxide.

fly_ash: coal combustion product that is composed of the particulates that are driven out of coal-fired boilers together with the flue gases.

Water: It is used to form a thick paste.

Superplasticizer:  used in making high-strength concrete.

Coasese_aggregate: prices of rocks obtain from ground deposits. 

fine_aggregate: the size of aggregate small than 4.75mm.

age: Rate of gain of strength is faster to start with and the rate gets reduced with age.

concrete_compressive_strength: Measurement unit of concrete strength.
